# Semester-Planner
The purpose of this website is to assist with the organization and planning of semester schedules.

All the information is being extracted **in real-time** from the University database, which can be accessed at https://www.ims.tau.ac.il/tal/kr/search_p.aspx

(Bidind statistics are scraped from https://www.ims.tau.ac.il/Bidd/Stats/Stats_P.aspx)

As a result, certain processes may take some time. However, there are plans to enhance efficiency in the future by implementing a database.
